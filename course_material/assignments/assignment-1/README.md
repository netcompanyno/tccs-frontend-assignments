Assignment 1 - Preparations
===========================

This assignment is all about making sure you have installed all the pre-requisites for this project.

1. For Windows users: If you don't have a proper command line for Windows we can recommend
   [cmder for Windows](http://cmder.net/).
   It emulates a Linux command prompt, which will make the rest of the day a lot easier for you.

2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Make sure that git is available on
   your command line.

3. Install [node (includes npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Check that you have access to node and npm from the command line:

```
> node -v
v9.11.1
> npm -v
5.8.0
```

4. Use your favorite IDE / editor and make sure it works. We recommend IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code. If you are using
   any other IDE, then you should know how to use it yourself.
   * Install a vue.js plugin, if available. This will make it a lot easier to develop.

5. We are using Chrome as the browser for this course. It is highly recommended to install the 
   [Vue plugin for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)

That's it. These are all the tools we will need today.
